# Errata {#errata}

## Preface

page xi, last word of first paragraph is **standaridzation**, s/b *standardization*

## Chapter 1

### Section 1.2.3.2, p. 11

The sentence of the 6th line on top of the page is

> We simulated the data according to the **hyothetical**

Should be *hypothetical*.

## Chapter 2

### section 2.4 Compute the standard error

The standard error formula used is with the standard deviation of the population and equivalent to

```{r }
#| eval: false
x <- whatifdat$Y[whatifdat$A == 1 & whatifdat$`T` == 1 & whatifdat$H ==1]
n <- length(x)
sd(x) * sqrt(n-1) / n
```

when the correct definition is with the standard deviation of the sample

```{r }
#| eval: false
x <- whatifdat$Y[whatifdat$A == 1 & whatifdat$`T` == 1 & whatifdat$H ==1]
n <- length(x)
sd(x) / sqrt(n)
```

### Figure 2.1, p. 30

This is really a small detail. The caption of the bottom plot is $\hat{E_{np}}(Y \mid A= 1, H =1, T = 1)$, s/b $\hat{E}_{np}$

## Chapter 3

### Page 37

The p-value found using a chi-square test is 3.207e-11. Using a t-test of the mean difference gives a p-value of 2.269e-9. It is not explained how the p-value of 0.032 is arrived at in the book.

### Typography: section 3.2 p. 40, equation 3.1

The current latex expression of conditional independence used seems to be `(Y(0), Y(1)) \ \text{II} \ T` with the output

$$
(Y(0), Y(1)) \ \text{II} \ T
$$

a better typography would be `\perp\!\!\!\perp` for the symbol $\perp\!\!\!\perp$. When used for equation 3.1 as `(Y(0), Y(1)) \perp\!\!\!\perp T` we obtain

$$
(Y(0), Y(1)) \perp\!\!\!\perp T
$$

In the case when we want to show dependence, that is *no independence* then the latex expression is `\not\!\perp\!\!\!\perp` for the symbol $\not\!\perp\!\!\!\perp$. For example equation 3.1 would become

$$
(Y(0), Y(1)) \not\!\perp\!\!\!\perp T
$$

## Chapter 4

### Section 4.1 p. 67 (on top)

The line is

> which is statistically **signficant**

should be *significant*

## Chapter 5

```{r echo=FALSE}
message("nothing found")
```

## Chapter 6

### Section 6.1 p. 100, first paragraph

The second sentence says

> Mistakingly equation $E_H E(Y \mid T=t \mid H)$ with \[...\]

Should it be $E_H (E(Y \mid T=t) \mid H)$? See extra $)$ before the last $\mid$.

### Section 6.3 p. 126, the script of `simdr`

The last paragraph of p. 126 says

> We simulated $T$ \[...\] such that approximaly 600 individuals had $T=1$

The `simdr` gives an incorrect result of 540 with the *constant 0.13*. That constant *should be 0.15* to obtain 600. See the mathematical proof and proof by simulation in the appendix *Doubly Robust Simulation* at [Analyse $T$](#errata6a).

## Chapter 7

### Section 7.2, equation (7.11), p. 139

> $$
\begin{align*}
E(Y_1 \mid A=1) - (E(Y_1\mid A=0, Y_0=1) - E(Y_1\mid A=0, Y_0=0)) - E(Y_0 \mid A=0) - (E(Y_1\mid A=0, Y_0=0) - E(Y_1\mid A=0, Y_0=0))
\end{align*}
$$

### Exercise 2

In the last paragraph of the exercise

> In addition, use `exsim.r` to simulate \[...\]

It should be `ex2sim.r`

## Chapter 8

### Section 8.2, p. 150

The very first sentence of section 8.2 says

> \[...\] the front-door **theorm** of Pearl \[...\]

It should be **theorem**

## Chapter 9

### Beginning of chapter, p. 158

Missing parentheses in the equation

$$
ITT = E(Y(1, A(1)) - E(Y(0, A(0))
$$ but is missing parentheses and should be

$$
ITT = E(Y(1, A(1))) - E(Y(0, A(0)))
$$

Based on the notation of mentioned in the second paragraph of p. 158, that we let $Y(t,a)$ be the potential outcome of $Y$ assuming we set $T=t$ and then $A=a$. Then the equation could be written more simply as

$$
ITT = E(Y(1, 1)) - E(Y(0, 0))
$$

### Section 9.3, p. 165

In the code for the example the problem is caused by the fact that `IV <- ITT / denom` does not work when `denom` is too small. What about setting the result to `NA` when `denom < tolerance` so the bootstrap will skip it and increase the number of bootstraps?

### Section 9.3, p. 169, 170, table 9.1

My results seem to be more consistent than the textbook's. Is this a mistake, how to test these results which can possibly be too good to be true.

## Chapter 10

### Section 10.3, code for equartiles.r

The following coding line is superfluous

`quartiles <- quantile(eb, c(0, .25, .5, .75, 1))`

## Chapter 11

### Section 11.2, p. 190

The data set **i17dat** is not in the material provided.

## Chapter 12

### section 12.1, p. 198

At the bottom of the page, th first sentence of the paragraph says

"by substituting parametric or **nonparmetric**. s/b **nonparametric**.

### section 12.3, p. 206

Just before the start of the exercise, beneath table 12.3

"is helpful of terms of **teasing** apart ...", s/b **tearing**
