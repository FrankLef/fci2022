## Difference-in-Differences (DiD) Estimators

### DiD Estimator with a Linear Model

> The method relies on consistency as well as assumption A1:

$$
\begin{align*}
&E(Y_1(0) \mid A=1) - E(Y_1(0) \mid A=1) = \\
&E(Y_0(0) \mid A=1) - E(Y_0(0) \mid A=1)
\end{align*}
$$

That assumption is interpreted as : If assume that no treatment was applied in "year" 1 (nothing happened in year 1) than we have the same results as in the base "year".

> also called **additive equi-confounding** \[...\]. The target of estimation is the linear ATT presented in chapter 6 as a risk difference

$$
\text{Linear ATT:} \: E(Y_1(1) - Y_1(0) \mid A=1)
$$ 

which is interpreted as \*what is the the average difference between $Y_1(1)$ and $Y_1(0)$ if they all treated. For the example of the bank's NIM, what is the average difference between the banks' NIM in NIRP ad non-NIRP economy assuming they are all subjected to the NIRP policy, that is wihout the impact of the NIRP policy.

and we have

$$
\begin{align*}
& E(Y_1(1) - Y_1(0)) \mid A=1) = \\
& E(Y_1(1) \mid A=1) - E(Y_1(0) \mid A=1) = \\
& [E(Y_1(1) \mid A=1) - E(Y_1(0) \mid A=1)] - [E(Y_1(0) \mid A=0) - E(Y_1(0) \mid A=0)] = \\
& [E(Y_1(1) \mid A=1) - E(Y_1(0) \mid A=0)] - [E(Y_1(0) \mid A=1) - E(Y_1(0) \mid A=0)] = \\
&\text{consistency assumption} \\
& [E(Y_1 \mid A=1) - E(Y_1 \mid A=0)] - [E(Y_1(0) \mid A=1) - E(Y_1(0) \mid A=0)] = \\
&\text{assumption A1, additive equi-confounding} \\
&\text{i.e. assuming that if nothing happens in year 1, then we can use the results of year 0} \\
& [E(Y_1 \mid A=1) - E(Y_1 \mid A=0)] - [E(Y_0 \mid A=1) - E(Y_0 \mid A=0)]
\end{align*}
$$

> we can therefore estimate the linear ATT via the difference in differences of averages

$$
\begin{align*}
&[\hat{E}(Y_1 \mid A=1) - \hat{E}(Y_1 \mid A=0)] - [\hat{E}(Y_0 \mid A=1) - \hat{E}(Y_0 \mid A=0)]= \\
&[\hat{E}(Y_1 \mid A=1) - \hat{E}(Y_0 \mid A=1)] - [\hat{E}(Y_1 \mid A=0) - \hat{E}(Y_0 \mid A=0)]= \\
&[\hat{E}(Y_1 - Y_0 \mid A=1)] - [\hat{E}(Y_1 - Y_0 \mid A=0)]
\end{align*}
$$

> We can also compute the DiD via the linear model

$$
E(Y_t \mid A) = \alpha_0 + \alpha_1 t + \alpha_2 A + \beta A * t
$$

and therefore

$$
\begin{align*}
\beta &= [E(Y_1 \mid A=1) - E(Y_0 \mid A=1)] - [E(Y_1 \mid A=0) - E(Y_0 \mid A=0)] \\
&= (\alpha_0 + \alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \beta) - (\alpha_0 + \alpha_2) - 
((\alpha_0 + \alpha_2) - (\alpha_0))
\end{align*}
$$

> As we can estimate $E(Y(1) \mid A=1)$ directly via $E(Y_1 \mid A=1)$, we can also recover $E(Y(0) \mid A=1)$ via $E(Y_1 \mid A=1) - \beta$

because from above we have

$$
\begin{align*}
\beta &= E(Y_1(1) - Y_1(0)) \mid A=1) \\
&= E(Y_1(1) \mid A=1) - E(Y_1(0) \mid A=1) \\
&= E(Y_1 \mid A=1) - E(Y_1(0) \mid A=1) \\
&\therefore \\
E(Y_1(0) \mid A=1)& = E(Y_1 \mid A=1) - \beta
\end{align*}
$$

### DiD Estimator with a Loglinear Model

> The method relies on consistency as well as assumption A2:

$$
\begin{align*}
\frac{E(Y_1(0) \mid A=1)}{E(Y_1(0) \mid A=1)} =
\frac{E(Y_0(0) \mid A=1)}{E(Y_0(0) \mid A=1)}
\end{align*}
$$

### DiD Estimator with a Logistic Model

> The method relies on consistency as well as assumption A3:

$$
\begin{align*}
logit(E(Y_1(0) \mid A=1)) - logit(E(Y_1(0) \mid A=1)) =
logit(E(Y_0(0) \mid A=1)) - logit(E(Y_0(0) \mid A=1))
\end{align*}
$$

## Comparison with Standardization

The functions used for DID estimations are `fciR::did_linear()`, `fciR::did_loglinear` and `fciR::logistic`.

### `doublewhatifdat`

The DiD estimator with the linear model

```{r }
#| label: ch07_dwhatif_did_lin
#| cache: true
dwhatif.did.lin <- fciR::boot_est(
    doublewhatifdat, func = fciR::did_linear,
    times = 100, alpha = 0.05, transf = "exp",
    terms = c("EY0A1", "EY1", "RD", "RR", "RR*", "OR"),
    formula = VL1 ~ A + VL0, exposure.name = "A", confound.names = "VL0")
```

The DiD estimator with the loglinear model

```{r }
#| label: ch07_dwhatif_did_loglin
#| cache: true
dwhatif.did.loglin <- fciR::boot_est(
    doublewhatifdat, func = fciR::did_loglinear,
    times = 100, alpha = 0.05, transf = "exp",
    terms = c("EY0A1", "EY1", "RD", "RR", "RR*", "OR"),
    formula = VL1 ~ A + VL0, exposure.name = "A", confound.names = "VL0")
```

The DiD estimator with the logistic model

```{r }
#| label: ch07_dwhatif_did_logit
#| cache: true
dwhatif.did.logit <- fciR::boot_est(
    doublewhatifdat, func = fciR::did_logistic,
    times = 100, alpha = 0.05, transf = "exp",
    terms = c("EY0A1", "EY1", "RD", "RR", "RR*", "OR"),
    formula = VL1 ~ A + VL0, exposure.name = "A", confound.names = "VL0")
```

verify the results

```{r}
#| label: ch07_fci_tbl_07_02
data("fci_tbl_07_02", package = "fciR")
bb_dwhatif <- fci_tbl_07_02
bb_dwhatif
```

```{r}
#| label: tbl-ch07_02
#| tbl-cap: Table 7.2
#| out-width: "100%"
gt_measures_rowgrp(
    bb_dwhatif, 
    rowgroup = "term",
    rowname = "model",
    title = paste("Table 7.2", "Double What-If Study"), 
    subtitle = paste("Difference-in-Differences Estimation of the ATT",
                     sep = "<br>")
    )
```

and the results using the `fciR` package are identical.

```{r}
tbl_7.2 <- rbind(
  data.frame(
    model = "Linear",
    dwhatif.did.lin), 
  data.frame(
    model = "Loglinear",
    dwhatif.did.loglin),
  data.frame(
    model = "Logistic",
    dwhatif.did.logit))
gt_measures_rowgrp(tbl_7.2,
    rowgroup = "term",
    rowname = "model",
    title = paste("Table 7.2<em>(by FL)</em>", "Double What-If Study", sep = "<br>"), 
    subtitle = paste("Difference-in-Differences Estimation of the ATT",
                     sep = "<br>")
  )
fciR::ggp_measures_groups(tbl_7.2, group = "model", 
                          title = paste("Table 7.2", "Double What-If Study"),
                          subtitle = paste("Difference-in-Differences Estimation of the ATT",
                                     sep = "<br>"))
```
