The results from the preliminary report on June 22, 20202 (RECOVERY Collaborative Group) (2020)) are as follows

```{r}
dataRecovery <- data.frame(
  `T` = c(0, 0, 1, 1),
  Y = c(0, 1, 0, 1),
  n = c(1065, 3256, 454, 2104)
)
```

and the estimate of survival $Y=1$ with treatment is

```{r}
p1 <- dataRecovery |>
  filter(`T` == 1) |>
  mutate(p = n / sum(n)) |>
  summarize(EYT1 = sum(Y * p))
p1
```

whereas the estimate of survival with treatment is

```{r}
p0 <- dataRecovery |>
  filter(`T` == 0) |>
  mutate(p = n / sum(n)) |>
  summarize(EYT0 = sum(Y * p))
p0
```

and the chi-square test of difference can be calculated as follows

```{r}
# create the data table
dataRecoveryChi <- data.frame(
  Y0 = c(T0 = 1065, T1 = 454),
  Y1 = c(T0 = 3256, T1 = 2104))
# perform the chi-square test
chisq <- chisq.test(dataRecoveryChi)
chisq
```

The p-value is small enough (\<0.05) to allow us to reject the null hypothesis that the treatment $T$ and the outcome $Y$ are independent.

*The author's chi-square test gives a p-value of 0.032 whereas the chi-square above gives 3.207e-11.* **Why the difference?**

If we use a *t-test* to also test the difference in means

```{r}
# we don't have the raw data, so we simulate
YT1 <- rbinom(n = 454 + 2104, size = 1, prob = 0.823)
YT0 <- rbinom(n = 1065 + 3256, size = 1, prob = 0.754)
ttest <- t.test(x = YT1, YT0, var.equal = FALSE)
ttest
```

and again the p-value are quite different with the same conclusion.

## Potential Outcomes and the Consistency Assumption

> The utility of the potential outcome framework hinges on the validity of a *consistency assumption* that links potential outcome to obe=served outcomes.

> It is worth emphasizing that the consistency assumption requires the potential outcomes to be well-defined.

> A major problem for causal inference is that we can only observe *one potential outcome per participant*. This is the *Fundamental Problem of Causal Inference* (FPCI).

We can therefore classify 4 causal types

$$
\text{Doomed:} \: Y(0) = Y(1) = 0 \\
\text{Responsive:} \: Y(0) = 0,  Y(1) = 1 \\
\text{Harmed:} \: Y(0) = 1,  Y(1) = 0 \\
\text{Immune:} \: Y(0) = Y(1) = 1 \\
$$

If we consider that the treatment cannot be harmful, in that case a patient with $Y=0$ must be doomed and an untreated patient with $Y=0$ must be immune.

$$
\text{Assuming the treatment cannot be harmful} \\ \\
\text{Doomed:} \: Y(0) = Y(1) = 0 \\
\text{Responsive:} \: Y(0) = 0,  Y(1) = 1 \\
\text{Immune:} \: Y(0) = 1 \\
$$

## Circumventing the Fundamental Problem of Causal Inference

There are 2 solutions to the FPCI

-   Scientific solution: We use scientific theory to measure both potential outcomes. For example by using 2 different participants that are considered identical for the purpose of the scientific study.

-   Statistical solution: The treatment is randomized independently of any existing data. As a result we obtain mean independence and the mean can be used to draw inference. This approach has some issues

    -   The difference between the outcome with or without treatment can still be caused by chance.
    -   The study populaiton may not be relevant anymore.
    -   Extrapolating an average result to an individdual might be problematic.

## Effect Measures

To estimate the association measures we use the parametric method with the `glm` function.

> We certainly do not believe that our binary outcomes the distributional assumtptions for the gaussian and poisson models, but we are only using the `glm` function to solve estimating equations.

```{r}
data("gss", package = "fciR")
gssrcc <- gss[, c("trump", "gthsedu", "magthsedu", "white", "female", "gt65")]
gssrcc <- gss[complete.cases(gssrcc), ]
stopifnot(nrow(gssrcc) == 2348 - 180)  # see comment on p. 46
```

```{r}
#| label: ch03_bootu
#| cache: true
uncond <- fciR::boot_est(gssrcc, func = fciR::meas_effect_uncond, times = 500,
                 alpha = 0.05, transf = "exp",
                 terms = c("P0", "P1", "RD", "RR", "RR*", "OR"), 
                 formula = trump ~ gthsedu)
```

```{r}
gt_measures(uncond, 
            title = "Table 3.2", 
            subtitle = paste("4 Association Measures Relating", 
            "<em>More than High School Education</em> to <em>Voting for Trump</em>", 
            sep = "<br>"))
```

```{r}
bb <- data.frame(
  term = c("P0", "P1", "RD", "RR", "RR*", "OR"),
  .estimate = c(0.23338, 0.27117, 0.037782, 1.1619, 1.0518, 1.221),
  .lower = c(0.21030, 0.24095, 0.00078085, 1.0047, 1.0006, 1.0056),
  .upper = c(0.25647, 0.30139, 0.07478354, 1.3437, 1.1057, 1.4853))
stopifnot(
  all((uncond$.estimate - bb$.estimate) < 0.01),
  all((uncond$.lower - bb$.lower) < 0.1),
  all((uncond$.upper - bb$.upper) < 0.1))
```

Now we estimate the four effect measures using *conditional* association measures.

To use the function with conditioning on variables, i.e. filtering on variables, we note that

$$
\begin{align*}
Y &= \text{trump} \\
T &= \text{gthsedu} \\
H_1 &= \text{magthsedu} \\
H_2 &= \text{white} \\
H_3 &= \text{female} \\
H_4 &= \text{gt65} \\
\end{align*}
$$

Therefore

$$
\begin{align*}
E(Y &\mid T = 0, H_1 = 1, H_2 = 1, H_3 = 1, H_4 = 1) \\
&\therefore \text{because T = 0} \\
Y &\sim H_1 + H_2 + H_3 + H_4 \\
\text{trump} &\sim \text{magthsedu} + \text{white} + \text{female} + \text{gt65} \\
\end{align*}
$$

```{r }
#| label: ch03_bootc
#| cache: true
a_formula <- trump ~ gthsedu + magthsedu + white + female + gt65
condit <- fciR::boot_est(gssrcc, func = fciR::meas_effect_cond,
                 times = 500, alpha = 0.05, seed = 1234, transf = "exp",
                 terms = c("P0", "P1", "RD", "RR", "RR*", "OR"),
                 formula = a_formula, exposure.name = "gthsedu",
                 confound.names = c("magthsedu", "white", "female", "gt65"))

```

```{r}
gt_measures(condit, 
            title = "Table 3.3", 
            subtitle = paste("4 Conditional Association or Effect Measures",
            "Relating <em>More than High School Education</em> 
            to <em>Voting for Trump</em>", sep = "<br>"))
```
