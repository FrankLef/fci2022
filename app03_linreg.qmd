# Linear Regression with R {#linreg}

```{r}
library(tidyr, quietly = TRUE)
library(dplyr, quietly = TRUE)
```

At about every turn in this book one needs to do a linear regression using `R`. It is a simple function, easy to use. Using it to translate the various mathematical expressions into values requires to learn its different flavors and what they mean in mathematical terms. It is one of those things we think we know well . . . until we actually have to use it.

The goal of this appendix is to explain these subtleties in the context of @shanninbrumback2021.

To illustrate we will use the `stats::glm()` function. Everything applies equally well to `stats::lm()`, `gee::gee()`, `geepack::geeglm()`, etc.

## Model

We will use the model from @shanninbrumback2021. in chapter 5, section 5.2, on page 89. Its DAG is illustrated in figure 5.7.

```{r}
sim2 <- function(n = 1000, seed = 888) {
  set.seed(seed)
  # Generate the observed confounder
  H <- rbinom(n, size = 1, prob = 0.4)
  # Let the treatment depend on the confounder
  probA <- H * 0.8 + (1 - H) * 0.3
  A <- rbinom(n, size = 1, probA)
  # Let the outcome depend on the treatment and the confounder
  probY <- A * (H * 0.5 + (1 - H) * 0.7) + (1 - A) * (H * 0.3 + (1 - H) * 0.5)
  Y <- rbinom(n, size = 1, prob = probY)
  data.frame("H" = H, "A" = A, "Y" = Y)
}
df <- sim2()
df |>
  skimr::skim()
```

## `fitted()` vs `predict()`

### `fitted()`

`fitted()` returns the expected values of the response *after* the link function is applied, i.e. $E(Y_I)$. Also `fitted()` uses only the original data.

For example

```{r}
n <- 5
x <- rnorm(n)
y <- rpois(n, lambda = exp(x))
df <- data.frame("x" = x, "y" = y)
fit <- glm(y ~ x, data = df, family = "poisson")
```

and `fitted()` give the $E(Y_i)$

```{r}
fitted.out <- fitted(fit)
fitted.out
```

and if you try to fit with new data, nothing will happen. It doesn't use the new data and returns the same output, *no warning is given about the fact that `newdata` is not used*.

```{r}
newdf <- df
newdf$x <- rnorm(n, mean = 1, sd = 0.5)
fitted(fit, newdata = newdf)
```

### `predict()`

On the other hand `predict` gives the result *before* the link function is applied *and* uses `newdata`

First lets use `predict()` with the existing data

```{r}
predict.out <- predict(fit)
predict.out
```

which is *before* the link function is applied and so

```{r}
exp(predict.out) == fitted.out
```

and there is an option, `type = "response"` that tells predict to applied the link function so you don't have to do it

```{r}
predict(fit, type = "response")
```

### Conclusion

In the context of @shanninbrumback2021 we use `fitted()` when we use the original data to get $E(E(Y_i))= \hat{Y}$ and `predict()..., type = "response`) when we ave a counterfactual in the data, that is $E(E(Y_i \mid T = t))= \hat{Y} \mid T=t$

```{r}
mean(fitted.out)
```
