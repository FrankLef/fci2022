## Conditional Probability

### Law of total probability

It is important to note that $\sum_i{H_i} = H$, that is $H$ can be partitioned in $i$ non-overlapping partitions.

Then the law of total probabilities is

$$
\begin{align*}
P(A) &= \sum_i{P(A \cap H_i)}= \sum_i{P(A \mid H_i) P(H_i)} \\
&\text{and we condition the whole expression with B} \\
P(A \mid B) &= \sum_i{P(A \cap H_i \mid B)}= \sum_i{P(A \mid B, H_i) P(B,H_i)} \\
\end{align*}
$$

and the multiplication rule is

$$
\begin{align*}
P(A, B \mid C) &= \frac{P(A, B, C)}{P(C)} \\
&= \frac{P(A \mid B, C) P(B, C)}{P(C)} \\
&= \frac{P(A \mid B, C) P(B \mid C) P(C)}{P(C)} \\
&= P(A \mid B, C) P(B \mid C)
\end{align*}
$$

## Conditional Expectation and the Law of Total expectation

The conditional expectation is defined as

$$
E(Y \mid T) = \sum_y y P(Y=y \mid T)
$$

and one way that helps me usually understand it well is that conditioning 
is the same as *filtering* the data.

For example the conditional expectation of mortality of US resident at the 
beginning of 2019 $E(Y \mid T = 1) = 0.0088$

```{r}
data("mortality_long", package = "fciR")
mortality_long |>
  # condition on T = 1
  filter(`T` == 1) |>
  # compute probabilities
  mutate(prob = n / sum(n)) |>
  # compute expectation for each possible value of Y
  group_by(Y) |>
  summarize(EYT1 = sum(Y * prob)) |>
  # output results in a named vector
  pull() |>
  setNames(nm = c("EY0T1", "EY1T1"))
```

where $E(Y=0 \mid T=1) = 0$ because when $Y=0 \implies 0 \cdot P(Y=0) = 0$ and *since* $Y$ is binary $E(Y=1 \mid T=1) = P(Y=1 \mid T=1)$.

> Analogous to the law of total probability is the law of ttal expectation, also called double expectation theorem.

This law is *used extensively in this textbook*.

$$
\begin{align*}
E(Y \mid T) &= E_{H \mid T}(E(Y \mid H, T)) \\
&= \sum_h \left[ \sum_y y P(Y=y \mid H=h, T) \right] P(H=h \mid T)
\end{align*}
$$ 

Also the following equivalence is used very often in this book.

$$
\begin{align*}
E(H \mid T) = \sum_h h P(H=h \mid T) = E_{H \mid T} (H)
\end{align*}
$$

### Mean independence and conditional mean independence

> The random variable $Y$ is mean independent of $T$ if

$$
E(Y \mid T) = E(Y)
$$

> and is conditionally mean independent of $T$ given $H$ is

$$
E(Y \mid T, H) = E(Y \mid H)
$$

and the *conditional uncorrelation* and uncorrelation are

$$
E(YT \mid H) = E(Y \mid H)E(T \mid H) \implies \text{conditionally uncorrelated} \\
E(YT) = E(Y)E(T) \implies \text{uncorrelated}
$$

> It happens that conditional mean independence implies conditional uncorrelation, but not the other way around.

We prove it as follows

$$
\begin{align*}
\text{assume Y is conditionally independent of T given H then} \\
E(Y \mid T, H) &= E(Y \mid H) \\ \\
\text{using double expectation theorem} \\
E(TY \mid H) &= E_{T \mid H}(E(TY \mid H, T)) \\
\text{expectation is a linear operator} \\
&= E_{T \mid H}(TE(Y \mid H, T)) \\
\text{by conditional mean independence from above} \\
&= E_{T \mid H}(TE(Y \mid H)) \\
\text{expectation is a linear operator} \\
&= E_{T \mid H}(T)E_{T \mid H}(E(Y \mid H)) \\
\text{which proves the conditional uncorrelation} \\
&= E(T \mid H)E(Y \mid H)
\end{align*}
$$

### Regression model

> A statistical model for a conditional expectation is called a *regression model*.

For a binary dataset the regression model is said to be *saturated* or *nonparametric* because the 4 proportions, or coefficients, cover all possibilities.

$$
E(Y \mid T, H) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 H + \beta_2 T + \beta_3 H * T
$$

When *unsaturated* or *parametric* the model makes an assumption. For example the following model assumes no interaction.

$$
E(Y \mid T, H) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 H + \beta_2 T
$$

### Nonlinear parametric models

The three parametric models, also the most well-known, used in the book are

$$
\begin{align*}
\text{linear: } \: E(Y \mid X_1, \ldots, X_p) &= \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \ldots + \beta_p X_p \\
\text{loglinear: } \: E(Y \mid X_1, \ldots, X_p) &= \exp{(\beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \ldots + \beta_p X_p)} \\
\text{logistic: } \: E(Y \mid X_1, \ldots, X_p) &= \text{expit}(\beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \ldots + \beta_p X_p)
\end{align*}
$$

The function `expit()` used by the author is actually the same as `gtools::inv.logit()`, `boot::inv.logit()` or `stats::plogis()`. In this project we use `stats::plogis()` to minimize dependencies since it is in base R.

## Estimation

This section is extremely important as it is used extensively, especially from the chapter 6 on.

Lets use the *What-if* example to illustrate the mathematics of it. In that case, we have 3 covariates, $T$ for naltrexone, $A$ for reduced drinking and $H$ for unsuppressed viral load. In the data set we have 165 observations, therefore $i=165$.

Let $X_i$ denote the collection of $X_{ij}$ for $j=1, \ldots, p$ where $p$ is the number of covariates which is 3 in the What-if dataset. $X_i$ is a **horizontal** vector.

So for the What-if study

$$
X_i = \begin{bmatrix}A_i & T_i & H_1 \end{bmatrix}
$$

and $\beta$ is a **vertical** vector.

$$
\beta = \begin{bmatrix}\beta_1 \\ \beta_2 \\ \beta_3 \end{bmatrix}
$$

therefore

$$
\begin{align*}
X_i \beta &= \begin{bmatrix}A_i & T_i & H_1 \end{bmatrix} \times \begin{bmatrix}\beta_1 \\ \beta_2 \\ \beta_3 \end{bmatrix} \\
&= \beta_1 A_i + \beta_2 T_i + \beta_3 H_i
\end{align*}
$$

we also have

$$
\begin{align*}
X_i^T (Y_i - X_i \beta) &= \begin{bmatrix}A_i \\ T_i \\ H_1 \end{bmatrix}(Y_i - \beta_1 A_i + \beta_2 T_i + \beta_3 H_i) \\
&= \begin{bmatrix}
A_i (Y_i - \beta_1 A_i + \beta_2 T_i + \beta_3 H_i) \\ 
T_i (Y_i - \beta_1 A_i + \beta_2 T_i + \beta_3 H_i) \\ 
H_1 (Y_i - \beta_1 A_i + \beta_2 T_i + \beta_3 H_i) 
\end{bmatrix}
\end{align*}
$$

Also, we can estimate the unconditional expectation of the binary outcome $Y$ as

$$
\hat{E}(Y) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n Y_i
$$

which returns the proportion of participants with unsuppressed viral load after 4 months

```{r}
data("whatifdat", package = "fciR")
mean(whatifdat$Y)
```

This is an unbiased estimator for $E(Y)$ because $E(\hat{E}(Y)) = E(Y)$

Now let the saturated model for $E(Y)$ be

$$
E(Y) = \beta
$$

with the following *estimating equation*

$$
U(\beta) = \sum_{i=1}^n (Y_i - \beta) = 0
$$

and simple algebra, using the estimate of $\hat{E}(Y)$ from above gives $\beta = \hat{E}(Y)$ and we use the notation $\hat{E}(Y) = E(Y \mid X, \beta)$ to show its dependency on the data and $\beta$.

$$
\begin{align*}
U(\beta) &= \sum_{i=1}^n (Y_i - \beta) \\
&= \sum_{i=1}^n \left[ Y_i - E(Y \mid X, \beta) \right] \\
&= 0
\end{align*}
$$ and to do the actual calculations we use a variation of the estimating equation as follows

$$
\begin{align*}
U(\beta) = \sum_{i=1}^n X_i^T \left[ Y_i - E(Y \mid X, \beta) \right] = 0
\end{align*}
$$

As an example, we fit the logistic regression model with the *What-if* dataset

$$
E(Y \mid A,T,H) = expit(\beta_0 + \beta_A A + \beta_T T + \beta_H H)
$$

```{r}
whatif.mod <- glm(Y ~ A + `T` + H, family = "binomial", data = whatifdat)
summary(whatif.mod)
```

The coefficients, $\beta_0, \beta_A, \beta_T, \beta_H$ are obtained with 
`coef()` which is an alias for `coefficient()`. The example in the book uses 
`lmod$coef` which is not a recommended coding practice. The data should be 
obtained with an extractor function such as `coef()`.

```{r}
coef(whatif.mod)
```

and since the model is binomial then the inverse function to convert from the 
logit scale to the natural scale is `stats::plogis()`.

Therefore the parametric estimate is

$$
E(Y \mid A=1, T=1, H=1) = \beta_0 + \beta_A \cdot 1 + \beta_T \cdot 1 + \beta_H \cdot 1
$$

```{r}
stats::plogis(sum(coef(whatif.mod)))
```

we can also use the linear model directly, thus avoiding a call to `plogis` 
and making the code a little more robust. This technique is used quite often 
in the book, especially starting from chapter 6 on.

```{r}
whatif.newdata <- whatifdat |>
  filter(A == 1, `T` == 1, H == 1)
whatif.EYT1 <- predict(whatif.mod, newdata = whatif.newdata, 
                            type = "response") |>
  mean()
whatif.EYT1
```

and we can validate the result directly using the dataset

```{r}
whatifdat.est <- whatifdat |>
  filter(A == 1, `T` == 1, H == 1) |>
  pull(Y) |>
  mean()
whatifdat.est
```

which is close to the parametric estimate.

## Sampling Distributions and the Bootstrap

The previous section prived and estimate. But how variable is this estimator? 
One way would be to report the standard error $\sigma_{\hat{x}} = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$. 
Therefore, since $\sigma^2 = p(1-p)$ for a binomial distribution

```{r}
# the sample size
whatifdat.n <- sum(whatifdat$A == 1 & whatifdat$`T` == 1 & whatifdat$H == 1)
# whatifdat.n

# the standard deviation
whatifdat.sd <- sqrt(whatifdat.est * (1- whatifdat.est))
# whatifdat.sd

# the standard error
whatifdat.se <- whatifdat.sd / sqrt(whatifdat.n)
whatifdat.se
```

Note that the formula used by B. Brumback is using the standard deviation of the 
population $p(1-p)$ which, maybe, is not entirely the right way since the 
standard error of the mean is defined using the *standard deviation of the sample*.

That is Brumback uses

```{r}
x <- whatifdat$Y[whatifdat$A == 1 & whatifdat$`T` == 1 & whatifdat$H ==1]
n <- length(x)
sd(x) * sqrt(n-1) / n
```

when the correct definition is

```{r}
x <- whatifdat$Y[whatifdat$A == 1 & whatifdat$`T` == 1 & whatifdat$H ==1]
sd(x) / sqrt(length(x))
```

> Another way would be by reporting the *sampling distribution* of our estimator.

> the sampling distribution is centered at the true value of our estimand and it has a standard deviation equal to the true standard error of our estimator.

The section 2.4 will not be repeated here, yet it is very instructive and cover a topic that we end to forget. We will just repeat the calculations below. They

The `sim()` function in section 2.4, p. 31 is coded in `fciR::sim_intervals()` 
and its alias `fciR::sim()`.

Run and verify with author's results on p. 32

```{r}
d <- fciR::sim_intervals(nsim = 500, n = 500)
stopifnot(abs(d$bad - 0.8374) < 0.03, abs(d$good - 0.948) < 0.03)
d
```

### Bootstrapping

> As we have seen, replacing $\mu$ and $\sigma$ with estimates leads to some problems, but we can still form an interpretable 95% confidence interval. In many situations, we do not have a good estimate of $\sigma$. In those cases, we often can turn to *bootstrap*.

Bootstrapping in base R is done with the `boot` from the `boot` package. Another option is the `rsample` package which isthe tidyverse way of doing it. Both methods will be used in this project. In the package `fciR`, the functions `boot_run` and `boot_est` use the classic R package `boot`. The functions `bootidy_run` and `bootidy_est` are similar but use the `rsample` package.

#### `boot` package

We use `boot::boot()` for boostrapping and `boot::boot.ci()` to compute the confidence interval of the estimand using the logistic model as done by the `lmodboot` function in section 2.4. We only run 100 boot samples since it is only an example. The default value is 1000.

The first 3 arguments `data`, `statistic` and `R` are specific to `boot`, the `...` is for extra arguments used by `lmodboot`. The details of `lmdboots` can be found in the package `fciR` or in its alias `fciR::prob_lmod`.

```{r}
prob_lmod(whatifdat, formula = Y ~ `T` + A + H)
```

and we show the details on how to do the bootstrapping with the `boot` package as follows.

```{r}
# define the function used by boot
whatifdat.fnc <- function(data, ids, ...) {
  dat <- data[ids, ]
  df <- prob_lmod(data = dat, ...)
  # create the named vector
  out <- c(df$estimate)
  names(out) <- df$term
  out
}
# run the bootstrapping
whatifdat.boot <- boot::boot(data = whatifdat, statistic = whatifdat.fnc, 
                             R = 100, formula = Y ~ `T` + A + H)
# get the confidence interval for every term in the bootstrap object
whatifdat.out <- lapply(X = seq_along(whatifdat.boot$t0), FUN = function(i, alpha = 0.05) {
  est <- whatifdat.boot$t0[i]
  # the method used to find the interval
  the_method <- "norm"
  # extract the interval from the boot object
  ci <- boot::boot.ci(whatifdat.boot, conf = 1 - alpha, type = the_method, 
                      index = i)$normal
  # the dataframe of results, follow the format from rsample package
  data.frame("term" = names(est),
    ".lower" = plogis(ci[2]),
    ".estimate" = plogis(unname(est)),
    ".upper" = plogis(ci[3]),
    ".alpha" = alpha,
    ".method" = the_method)
  })
# bind the data.frame in one.
# In this case it makes no difference as there is only one.
# and we just want to show how it works in case of several items
whatifdat.out <- do.call(rbind, whatifdat.out)
whatifdat.out
```

#### `rsample` package

Another way package that could be used for boostrapping is `rsample::bootstrap` 
which uses the tidyverse way of R programming.

To be fully tidyverse-like we recode the `prob_lmod` function from above and call it `prob_lmod_td` where the `td` suffix stands for `tidyverse`. Note the use of a formula as an argument to the function and the `rlang` package which is a great tool to learn for quality code in R.

```{r}
prob_lmod_td <- function(data, formula = Y ~ `T` + A + H,
                         condition.names = NULL) {
  # independent variables from the formula
  f_vars <- all.vars(rlang::f_rhs(formula))
  # if condition.names is NULL then use all independent variables
  # which is the same as saying there is no condition
  if (is.null(condition.names)) condition.names <- f_vars
  stopifnot(all(condition.names %in% f_vars))

  # add intercept to conditions
  x0 <- "(Intercept)"  # name of intercept used by lm, glm, etc.
  condition.names <- c(x0, condition.names)
  
  
  fit <- glm(formula = formula, family = "binomial", data = data) |>
    tidy()
  fit |>
    filter(term %in% condition.names) |>
    summarize(term = "logitP",
              estimate = sum(estimate),
              # don't know the std.err so no t-intervals
              std.err = NA_real_)
}
```

```{r}
t <- prob_lmod_td(whatifdat, formula = Y ~ `T` + A + H)
t
```

The following function is inspired from [rsample bootstrap](https://rsample.tidymodels.org/articles/Applications/Intervals.html).

We obtain the confidence interval using `rsample::int_pctl` which uses a 
percentile interval instead of assuming a normal distribution as Ms Brumback does. 
The result are not materially different in the current case.

```{r}
#| label: ch02_whatifdat_boot
#| cache: true
whatifdat |>
  rsample::bootstraps(times = 1000, apparent = FALSE) |>
  mutate(results = map(splits, function(x) {
    dat <- analysis(x)
    prob_lmod_td(dat, formula = Y ~ `T` + A + H)})
    ) |>
  rsample::int_pctl(statistics = results, alpha = 0.05) |>
  mutate(term = "P",
         .lower = plogis(.lower),
         .estimate = plogis(.estimate),
         .upper = plogis(.upper))
```

and `lmodboot()` is `fciR::boot_lmod()` with the alias `fciR::lmodboot()`

Finally we run `fciR::boot_lmod()` and verify against the author's results on p.34

```{r}
#| label: ch02_lmodboot
#| cache: true
fciR::boot_est(whatifdat, func = fciR::prob_lmod, times = 500,
                 alpha = 0.05, seed = 123, transf = "expit", terms = NULL,
                 formula = Y ~ `T` + A + H)
```
